# MongoDB

## What is MongoDB ?
MongoDB is a type of database that can store data in a flexible way, similar to how you would write data in a document. Unlike traditional databases,
it does not need a fixed structure for storing data. Instead, it allows you to store data in a format that works best for your application.
MongoDB is used by many modern web and mobile applications to store and manage their data.

## What are NoSQL databases? How do they differ from SQL?
NoSQL databases are a type of database that store and retrieve data in a flexible and scalable way. 
They do not use fixed structures like SQL databases, but instead use different data models to store data.
NoSQL databases are designed to handle big data challenges and are highly scalable and available. SQL databases, on the other hand, use a fixed schema and are better suited for applications that require strong consistency and ACID properties.
